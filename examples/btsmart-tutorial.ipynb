    "\n",
    "In order to play with the controller, we build the following simple scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "A button, a lamp and a motor elements are attached to the bt-smart controller (button on input1, lamp on output1 and motor on output2).\n",
    "\n",
    "When the button is pushed (contact closed), the lamp should be turned on and the motor shoul run for a short time.\n",
    "When the button is released (contact open), the lamp should be turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, that is all we need to also build mor complex scenarios such a a light barrier for cars, triggering a traffic light or opening a gate. but we will get back to that later on.\n"

    "  this library contains everything we need to handle asynchronuous programs, which means\n",
    "  programs that are not purely sequences, but may run in parallel (e.g. a light may blink while a motor turns)\n",
    "- btsmart\n",
    "  this is the library containing the btsmart-related classes, which are:\n",
    "  - BTSmartController\n",
    "    this class helps us to connect and manipulate the btsmart controller. It allows us to measure or react on \n",
    "    input value changes or to set output values.\n",
    "    However, this class is still pretty \"technical\", so we use some additionaly classes...\n",
    "  - Button\n",
    "    this class represents a button (switch) attached to an input of the controller. It triggers events when the \n",
    "    button is pressed or when it is released, so we can use it to simply react on these events.\n",
    "  - Dimmer\n",
    "    this class basically sets the output level to a value between 0 and 100 in order to regulate the light \n",
    "    intensity, given that the output is attached to a lamp. It also provides means for blinking.\n",
    "  - MotorXM\n",
    "    this class provides functions to start, stop or run the attached motor for a certain amount of time with\n",
    "    a given rpm value rather than using the values specified by the underlying BLE-protocol used by the controller\n",
